# Maze-Search-Algorithms-UCS-Astar
Solving NxN mazes with the UCS and A* algorithms. Artificial Intelligence course assignment @cse.uoi.gr.

Consider a square grid having many obstacles and we are given a starting cell and 2 target cells G1 and G2. We want to reach one target cell (if possible) from the starting cell as quickly as possible.

We will use two different algorithms:

* USC algorithm with all the costs being 1 from every node to another.
* A* algorithm heuristic calculation with Euclidean Distance.
